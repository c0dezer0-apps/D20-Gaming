# D20-Gaming
A home for text-based roleplaying. 

## What will I be able to do?
- As D20 Staff:
  - Enforce global rules.
  - Decide the fate of games.
  - Help develop the app (if a developer).
  - Help advertise the app.
  - Throw pizza parties.
  - Live in a luxurious home this is entirely a figment of my imagination.
- As a Game Master:
  - Create immersive universes/worlds where players can play as a character they create in the story that you write.
    - D20 will support freeform and DnD style gameplay with dice.
    - D20 will support either custom worlds/universes or allow you to create worlds from other universes like Star Trek, Stargate, etc.
  - Create world templates to allow other GMs to use to create their own games based within your universe (if it is a custom universe you built or have exclusive rights to).
  - Choose D20 provided templates for existing universes (like Star Trek, DnD, Warcraft, etc).
    - Can modify and distribute these templates.
  - Create plots, storylines, and environments your playerbase can interact with.
  - Create characters that can be either NPC's or taken over to be played as a character.
  - Manage characters, npc or pc, and their content.
  - Manage the world you create.
  - Play as your own character in your own world.
  - Assign mod powers to other users, with your own set of rules.
    - Can set approval of mod actions to auto, require review, or deny.
    - Will allow you as a Game Master to dictate how a mod can help create the world you want.
  - Set your own social guidelines and rules (that don't contradict those set forth by the D20 Staff, i.e. me).
  - Create organizations that consist of like-themed games, either in their own universes or in the same universe.
  - In a DnD style game, decide the outcome of dice rolls.
    - Can pre-determine responses to dice-rolls for certain actions.
    - Can pre-script actions that your players are allowed to take in choice format to facilitate this.
  - Manage game chat.
  - Open/close game to new applicants.
  - Archive/close games when interest dies.
  - Create one-time direct recruitment links to allow players to sign-up irregardless of open status.
- As a Game Mod:
  - Manage player content following the rules the Game Master permits.
  - Help create the world the GM envisions.
  - Enforce social rules, local and global.
- As a player:
  - Create various characters.
    - Create variations of characters for the purpose of using in multiple games.
  - Join as many games as you can handle, and use your characters in as many worlds as you want.
  - Write plot-based actions and responses.
  - Write personal stories based in the game world (like flashbacks or other stuff that doesn't relate or effect on-going plots).
  - Write joint actions and responses with other players in a live setting (will behave like a chat).
  - In a Dnd-style game, roll dice for various actions to decide their outcome.
  - Create your own plot ideas and suggestions to be reviewed by game staff.
  - Create your own NPCs and put them in games at staff discretion.
  - Invite friends to join your game, if ability is permitted by GM.
- As an observer:
  - Watch game events as they unfold.
  - Chat in an OOC (out-of-character) channel with the players if allowed by game staff.
  - Chat in a 'welcome/recruitment' chat created for visitors, which is enabled/disabled depending if game is open to recruitment.
    - Intended to be a QnA-type chat for prospective players.
